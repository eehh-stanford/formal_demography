# formal_demography

This is a repository of `R` code for formal demography. The code here complements my class, [Demography and Life History Theory](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ess363/) and also collects some of the material from our now ancient Stanford Workshops in Formal Demography. It is very much a work in progress.
